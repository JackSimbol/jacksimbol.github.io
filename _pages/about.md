I'm a Phd student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn). My research interest includes game AI, multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. WenXin Li](https://ai.pku.edu.cn/rydw/js/21804.htm) of [AI Lab](https://ai.pku.edu.cn/).
